#  Chapter 02 - Assignment - Igniting our App
 # Theory Assignment: 
 ●   - What is `NPM`? 
        - `NPM is manage the packages.`
 ●   - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it? 
        - `ParcelJS describes itself as a blazingly fast, zero-configuration web application budler.`
        - `Parcel optimizes whole app for production automatically. This includes tree-shaking and minifying JavaScript, CSS and HTML, resizing and optimizing images, content hashing, automatic code splitting, and much more.`
 ●   - What is `.parcel-cache` 
        - `A directory generated by the Parcel bundler, a popular tool used for bundling and optimizing web applications. It serves a specific purpose in the build process.`
 ●   - What is `npx` ? 
        - `NPX means to executing the packages.`
 ●   - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies` 
        - `dependencies: Packages required for application in production.`
        - `devDependencies: Packages required only for in local developement stage.`
 ●   - What is Tree Shaking? 
        - `Tree Shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.`
        `or`
        - `Tree shaking or dead code elimination means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process.`
 ●   - What is Hot Module Replacement? 
        - `HMR - is a powerful feature designed to enhance the developement process by providing the real-time updates to modules within a running application.`
 ●   - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your 
 own words. 
        - `Local server - by run the npx parcel index.html my code will runs in local server, to easy to validate my project execution.`
        - `File watching algorithm - written in C++`
        - `caching - Faster Builds`
        - `Image Optimization`
        - `Minification - It minify all the HTML, CSS and JS codes`
        - `Compress - reduce the files size and remove the white-spaces and create the bundlers`
        - `Consistent Hashing`
 ●   - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it? 
        - `It is used to add the files not commit into the Git, we can add list of files which we can reprodusables things and essential files we can't add in this folder.`
 ●   - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json` 
        - `In the Package.json file having the list of dependencies and devDependencies packages with version numbers`
        - `In this package-lock.json file having the exact version related list of dependencies packages installations support for project run in production`
 ●   - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
        - `If we modify the package-lock.json file we may face issues in application runs in local/production.`
 ●   - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git? 
        - `node_modules are the packages having the predefined code which we add in the list of packages in the package.json file. And this modules not good to push in git because these modules are reprodusables.`
 ●   - What is the `dist` folder? 
        - `When we execute the project using the parcel at that time parcel will create the bundlers of the project that bundlers are moved to this dist folder. Using this dist folder code will run the application in the browsers.`
 ●   - What is `browserlists` 
        - `browserlists is a configuration file that determines which browsers your should project supports.`
